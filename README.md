This script will:

Download and preprocess the text8 dataset.
Load the distilgpt2 model and its tokenizer.
Tokenize the dataset and create a DataLoader to handle batching of inputs.
Fine-tune the model on the dataset.
Save the fine-tuned model.
You can run this script by copying it into a main.py file and running it with Python. The fine-tuned model will be saved in the saved_model directory.

Please note that fine-tuning a language model can be a time-consuming process, even with a smaller model like distilgpt2 and a small dataset.
